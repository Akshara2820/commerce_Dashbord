            Loram Maintenance of Way was founded in 1954 in Hamel, Minnesota, in
            the United States[2] by Canadian businessman Fred C. Mannix. The
            company name is a portmanteau derived from the phrase "long-range
            Mannix".[3] Loram initially acted as a contractor for railways,
            cleaning ballast on track beds. The rough edges of ballast rock not
            only supports the ties and holds them in place, it helps water drain
            away from the track bed. Over time, ballast becomes clogged with
            earth, weeds, and debris, inhibiting its drainage properties. Its
            major competitor in this field was Speno Rail Services (later owned
            by Pandrol-Jackson, and still later by Harsco Technologies).[4] Over
            time, Loram replaced its large work crews with automated machines
            which can clean ballast 2 to 2.5 feet (0.61 to 0.76 m) in depth.
